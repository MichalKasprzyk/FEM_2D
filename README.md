# FEM 2D

  This is simplified approach for Finite Element Menthod with grid being square. You can input your own parameters by modifying grid.txt file, though you need to stick to its naming convention due to my own rushed parsing. Program then calculates appropriate amount of nodes, distance between then, Jacobian, global matrixes G and H, main integral through numerical Gauss method and prints out temperature vector. By default boundries condition was set on all 4 walls. 
  
  This was written long time ago and is no way in optimized shape and requires a lot of cleanup to make it readable and worthwhile of your time, please be wary of this fact!
