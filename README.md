# FEM_2D
Simplified approach to Finite Element Method in 2D

  This is simplified approach for FEM with grid being square. You can input your own parameters by modifying grid.txt file, though you need to stick to its naming convention due to my own rushed parsing. Program then calculates appropriate amount of nodes, distance between then, Jacobian, global matrixes G and H and then finishes calculating integral and prints out temperature vector on each node. By default boundries condition was set on all 4 walls. This was written long time ago and is no way in optimized shaped and requires a lot of cleanup to make it readable and worthwhile of your time.
